X-LINUX-AZURE is an STM32 MPU OpenSTLinux Expansion Package that targets Microsoft Azure IoT Edge for STM32MP25xx product microprocessors.  

It integrates IoT Edge runtime modules to turn STM32MP25 into an IoT Edge device to start and accelerate the development of an IoT solution.  

In addition, this OpenSTLinux Expansion Package provides good security practices with the integration of a secure solution for credential storage. This solution is based on the usage of OP-TEE and TPM.  

X-LINUX-AZURE includes a grapical demonstration application which interacts with IoT edge runtime to display configuration, list and restart installed modules.

## Versioning
Since its release v5.1.0, the major and minor versions of the X-LINUX-AZURE OpenSTLinux Expansion Package are aligned on the major and minor versions of the OpenSTLinux Distribution. This prevents painful backward compatibility attempts and makes dependencies straightforward.

The X-LINUX-AZURE generic versioning v**x**.**y**.**z** is built as follows:
* **x**: major version matching the OpenSTLinux Distribution major version. Each new major version is incompatible with previous OpenSTLinux Distribution versions.
* **y**: minor version matching the OpenSTLinux Distribution minor version. Each new minor version might be incompatible with previous OpenSTLinux Distribution versions.
* **z**: patch version to introduce bug fixes. A patch version is implemented in a backward compatible manner.
